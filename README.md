MILA language compiler. Work of students & professors @ CTU - I did just some extensions to the code to make it work with arrays, hexa constants and maybe even something else (minor changes though, do not remember exactly). I use this just as a backup of my term work so keep that in mind. If you are the author of some of the code and you feel uncomfortable with me having the it here just let me know.

THIS IS A MESS! You have been warned, it works but the code is awful, has no comments, uses Czech, has variables with almost identical names and many many other things that will probably make you go crazy. But it is a nice example of how compilers work when using some kind of AST.


usage
=====

compile the compiler and use it to compile your programs ;)
